                            <p> comment - piece of code that is ignored by the language, it doesn't do anything. </p>
                            <p> Well-commented code - hallmark of a ninja programmer.</p>
                            <p> // single line comment finishing at the end of the line </p>
                            <p> /* multi-line comments finishing with */</p>
                            <p> reserved words - abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char,
                              class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do,
                              double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally,
                              float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in,
                              instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null,
                              package, private, protected, public, return, short, static,
                              super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient,
                              true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</p>
                            <p><em>const</em> - used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value</p>
                            <p><em>let</em> - used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program</p> 
                            <p>Using <em>const</em> and <em>let</em> to declare variables means they are block scoped, their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.</p>
                            <p>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have <b>global scope</b> -  meaning  accessible everywhere in the program.</p>  
                            <p>Any variables inside a block using the <em>let or const </em> will only be available inside that
                              block and not be accessible outside of that block is known <b>local scope</b>.</p>  
                            <p>If <em>let or const </em> are <b>not used</b>, the variable will have global scope and be available
                              outside the block</p>  
                            <p>Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _, or dollar character, $. They are case sensitive too.</p>  
                            <p>String - a collection of characters. We can create a string literal by writing characters inside quote marks like this 'hello'.</p>
                            <p>If you want to use an apostrophe in your string, you will need to use double quote marks to enclose the string, otherwise the apostrophe will terminate the string, causing an error.</p>
                            <p>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as: 
                              Single quote marks \'                      
                              Double quote marks \"
                              End of line \n
                              Carriage return \r
                              Tab \t </p>   
                            <p><b>Properties</b> are information about the object or value, while <b>methods</b> perform an action on the object or value ― either to change it or to tell us something about it. To call a
                              method, we use the dot operator (.) followed by the name of the method, followed by parentheses (this is a useful way to distinguish between a property and a method ― methods end with parentheses). </p>   
                            <p>A shortcut for string concatenation is to use the + operator to add the two strings together: 'Java' + 'Script' + ' ' + 'Ninja';  << 'JavaScript Ninja'</p>    
                            <p><b>NaN</b> is an error value that is short for "Not a Number"</p>
                            <p><b>Null</b> means “no value”. </p>
                            <p>Placing the <b>!</b> operator in front of a value will convert it to a Boolean and return the opposite value. So truthy values will return false, and falsy values will return true. This is known as negation.</p>
                            <p><b>!!</b> shortcut to using the Boolean function</p>

                      <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops)</h5>
                             <p>Array - an ordered list of values example <b> const myArray = [ ]; <<[ ]</b> </p>
                             <p>Set - is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values</p>
                             <p>Maps -  are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to “hashes”, or“hash tables” or “dictionaries” in other programming languages.</p>
                             <p>An <b>if</b> statement - inside the block will only run if the condition in parentheses is true.</p>
                             <p>The <b>else</b> keyword - is  used to add an alternative block of code to run if the condition is false.</p>
                             <p> <b>Loops</b> will repeat a piece of code over and over again according to certain conditions</p>
                             <p> </p>

                      <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Ch4: Functions)</h5>
                            <p>Function - a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small, self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow. </p>
                            <p>Keep your Code DRY or Don't Repeat Yourself - a programming principle that  specifies that every part of a program should only be written once. </p>
                            <p>Parametersandargumentsare terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. Any parameters a function needs are set when the function isdefined. When a function isinvoked, it is provided with arguments.</p>
                            <p>A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a <b>callback</b>.</p>
                            <p>Refactoring is the process of improving the code’s structure and maintainability without changing its behavior. </p>
