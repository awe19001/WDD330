                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition ( Ch11: Further Functions)</h5>
                       <p>Functions are first-class objects in Jacascript. They can be passed around in the same way as every other value. </p>    
                       <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an
                        object that is provided as the first argument.</p>      
                       <p>An <b>Immediately Invoked Function Expression </b>– or IIFE (pronounced “iffy”) – is
                        an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s
                        defined.</p>       
                       <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call
                        itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an
                        anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</p>       
                       <p>Lazy Definition Pattern and is often used when some
                        initialization code is required the first time it’s invoked. This means the
                        initialization can be done the first time it’s called, then the function can be
                        redefined to what you want it to be for every subsequent invocation.</p>      
                       <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s
                        a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.</p>    
                       <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code
                        will ever be processed at a time. T</p>      
                       <p>Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code.</p>       
                       <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. </p>       
                       <p>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to
                        be pending. </p>   
                       <p>Two different outcomes: Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.
                        Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn’t
                        successfully completed or resulted in an error.
                        </p>   
                       <p>Closures are one of JavaScript’s most powerful features, but they can be difficult
                        to get your head around initially.
                        </p>   
                       <p>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function,
                        maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</p>   
                       <p>Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions. It’s named
                        after the logician Haskell Curry — not the spicy food — just like the
                        programming language Haskell is.</p>
