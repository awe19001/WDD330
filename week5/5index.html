                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition ( Ch10: Testing and Debugging)</h5>
                       <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there.</p>         
                       <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program.</p>
                       <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the program to crash. </p>
                       <p>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: <em>'use strict';</em></p>
                       <p>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file. </p>     
                       <p>Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint re designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
                        if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented</p>
                       <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. </p>
                       <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked.</p>
                       <p>The console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the
                        console.</p>     
                       <p>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility</p>
                       <p>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</p>     
                       <p>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. </p>
                       <p>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax</p>     
                       <p>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</p>
                       <p>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</p>     
                       <p>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion. </p>
                       <p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</p> 
                       <p>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code</p>
