                       <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there.</p>         
                       <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program.</p>
                       <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the program to crash. </p>
                       <p>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: <em>'use strict';</em></p>
                       <p>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file. </p>     
                       <p>Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint re designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
                        if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented</p>
                       <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. </p>
                       <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked.</p>
                       <p>The console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the
                        console.</p>     
                       <p>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility</p>
                       <p>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</p>     
                       <p>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. </p>
                       <p>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax</p>     
                       <p>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</p>
                       <p>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</p>     
                       <p>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion. </p>
                       <p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</p> 
                       <p>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code</p>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Ch12: Object Oriented Programming)</h5>
                  <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.</p>  
                  <p> There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. </p>  
                  <p><em>Encapsulation</em> involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.</p> 
                  <p><em>Polymorphism</em> various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p> 
                  <p><em>Inheritance</em> means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p> 
                  <p><em>Class-based</em>languages, such as Java and Ruby, use a class to define a blueprint for an object.</p> 
                  <p><em>Prototypebased</em> language d used the concept of using actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects.</p>                              
                  <p>An alternative way to create objects is to use a <em>constructor function</em> -  a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. The keyword <em>this</em> is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</p>
                  <p>A golden rule to remember is: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</p>
                  <p>Giving users or external services too much access to properties and methods could be a recipe for disaster! </p>
                  <p>Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non-enumerable. If they aren’t enumerable, this means they will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an object’s properties and methods.</p>
                  <p>The get() and set() methods can be used to control how a property is set using assignment and the value that is returned when a property is queried.</p>
                  <p>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.</p>
                  <p>The bind() method is a method for all functions and is used to set the value of this in the function. </p>
                  <p>You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. The “Gorilla Banana” problem occurs when you need a method from an object, so you inherit from that object. The name comes from a quote by Joe Armstrong, the creator of the Erlang programming language.</p>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition  (Ch15: Modern Javascript)</h5>
                      <p> JavaScript is an extremely flexible language that can accomplish most programming tasks – but not all undertakings are as easy to do as they should be.</p>
                      <p>jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today. </p> 
                      <p>A big advantage of using jQuery is its support for older browsers, particularly Internet Explorer.  </p> 
                      <p> A library should not be used because of a lack of understanding of JavaScript. Instead, it should be used to speed up JavaScript development by making it easier to complete common tasks.</p> 
                      <p> The coupling of code refers to how dependent certain elements or modules of code are on each other. </p> 
                      <p><em>Default exports</em> refer to a single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named.  </p> 
                      <p> Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time in server-side languages. </p> 
                      <p> Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. </p> 
                      <p>Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information.</p>
                      <p>Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them.</p>
                      <p><em>npm </em>allows you to install JavaScript packages onto your machine. Some packages rely on other packages, so npm acts as a dependency manager</p>
                      <p>The  <em>npm init</em> command is used when you start a project. It walks you through creating a package.json file. </p>
                      <p>Minification is the process of removing any unnecessary characters from your code to reduce the file size.</p>
                      <p>Code that needs to be transpiled is often placed inside a folder called src (short for “source”). </p>  
                      <p>The output of any transpiled code from the src folder is usually placed inside a folder called dist (short for “distribution”). </p>
                      <p>Any modules are usually stored in a folder called lib (short for “library”) that is usually placed inside the src folder. </p>

                          <p>Is there any example of forms that uses backend in this book? That uses PHP or something?</p>
