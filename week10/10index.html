                <li><h5>MDN: Validating forms</h5>
                      <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format, this is called client-side form validation. </p>
                      <p>You should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server.</p>
                      <p> Form validation</p>
                      <p>"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).<br>
                        "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).<br>
                        "Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).<br>
                        "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data format is required for your data).<br></p> 
                      <p>Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.</p> 
                      <p>Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but it always requires you to think carefully about the user. Always remember to help your users correct the data they provide.</p>

                <li><h5>MDN: Using Fetch</h5>
                      <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.</p>
                      <p>Use fetch() to POST JSON-encoded data.</p>
                      <p>A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side, although this usually means permission issues or similar — a 404 does not constitute a network error.</p> 
                      <p>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor. A headers object is a simple multi-map of names to values.</p>
                      <p>The Response() constructor takes two optional arguments — a body for the response, and an init object (similar to the one that Request() accepts.)</p>
