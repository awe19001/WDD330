                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Formms)</h5>
                       <p>Forms are made up of a <em><form> </em>element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</p>
                       <p>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.</p>  
                       <p>The <em>focus</em> event occurs when an element is focused on. </p>  
                       <p>The <em>blur </em>event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</p>  
                       <p>The <em>change </em>event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form elementafter changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won’t fire, but the blur event will.</p>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Ch12: Object Oriented Programming)</h5>
                  <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.</p>  
                  <p> There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. </p>  
                  <p><em>Encapsulation</em> involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.</p> 
                  <p><em>Polymorphism</em> various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p> 
                  <p><em>Inheritance</em> means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p> 
                  <p><em>Class-based</em>languages, such as Java and Ruby, use a class to define a blueprint for an object.</p> 
                  <p><em>Prototypebased</em> language d used the concept of using actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects.</p>                              
                  <p>An alternative way to create objects is to use a <em>constructor function</em> -  a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. The keyword <em>this</em> is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</p>
                  <p>A golden rule to remember is: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</p>
                  <p>Giving users or external services too much access to properties and methods could be a recipe for disaster! </p>
                  <p>Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non-enumerable. If they aren’t enumerable, this means they will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an object’s properties and methods.</p>
                  <p>The get() and set() methods can be used to control how a property is set using assignment and the value that is returned when a property is queried.</p>
                  <p>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.</p>
                  <p>The bind() method is a method for all functions and is used to set the value of this in the function. </p>
                  <p>You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. The “Gorilla Banana” problem occurs when you need a method from an object, so you inherit from that object. The name comes from a quote by Joe Armstrong, the creator of the Erlang programming language.</p>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition  (Ch7: Events)</h5>
                      <p> <em>Events</em> are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing </p>
                      <p>Event listeners in JavaScript work in much the same way. They are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. </p>
                      <p>The <em>addEventListener() </em>method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied.</p>
                      <p>Be careful when using the <em>touchstart </em>event as it fires as soon as a user touches the screen. They may be touching the screen because they want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent them from doing this.</p>  
                      <p>The <em>touchmove</em> event occurs after a user has touched the screen then moves
                        around without leaving.</p>
                      <p>The <em>touchcenter</em> event occurs when a user has already started touching the surface, but then passes over the element to which the event listener is attached</p>
                      <p>The <em>touchleave </em>event occurs when the user is still touching the surface, but leaves the element to which the event listener is attached.</p>
                      <p>The <em>touchcancel </em>event occurs when a touch event is interrupted, such as a user’s finger moving outside the document window, or too many fingers being used at once. A pop-up dialog will also cancel a touch event. </p>
                      <p>The <em>preventDefault() </em>is a method of the event object that can be used inside the callback function to stop the default behavior happening. </p>

                          <p>Why did we jump on Chapter 12? After Chapter 8 it's suppose to be Chapter 9, right?</p>
                          <p>Is there any example of forms that uses backend in this book? That uses PHP or something?</p>
                          <p>On page 448 ES6 Class Declarations example (Novice to Ninja)  roll() {return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)}, why there's a '+ 1'?</p>
