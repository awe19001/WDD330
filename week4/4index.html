                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Formms)</h5>
                       <p>Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</p>
                       <p></p>  
                       <p></p>  
                       <p></p>  
                       <p></p>  
                       <p></p>  
                       <p></p>       
                </li>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition ( Ch6: Document Object Model)</h5>
                      <p>The <em>Document Object Model</em>, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure. </p>
                      <p>The <em>getElementById() </em>method does exactly what it says on the tin. It returns a reference to the element with a unique id attribute that is given as an argument. Every id attribute should be unique to just one element.</p>  
                      <p>The <em>getElementsByTagName() </em>will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag name that is provided as an argument.  </p>
                      <p>The <em>getElementsByClassName() </em>will return a live node list of all elements that have the class name that is supplied as an argument. </p>
                      <p>The <em>document.querySelector() </em>method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return null.</p>
                      <p>The <em>document.querySelectorAll() </em>method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector</p>
                      <p>The <em>classList property</em> is a list of all the classes an element has. It has a number of methods that make it easier to modify the class of an element. </p>
                      <p>The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.</p>
                </li> 

                
                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition  (Ch7: Events)</h5>
                      <p> <em>Events</em> are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing </p>
                      <p>Event listeners in JavaScript work in much the same way. They are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. </p>
                      <p>The <em>addEventListener() </em>method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied.</p>
                      <p>Be careful when using the <em>touchstart </em>event as it fires as soon as a user touches the screen. They may be touching the screen because they want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent them from doing this.</p>  
                      <p>The <em>touchmove</em> event occurs after a user has touched the screen then moves
                        around without leaving.</p>
                      <p>The <em>touchcenter</em> event occurs when a user has already started touching the surface, but then passes over the element to which the event listener is attached</p>
                      <p>The <em>touchleave </em>event occurs when the user is still touching the surface, but leaves the element to which the event listener is attached.</p>
                      <p>The <em>touchcancel </em>event occurs when a touch event is interrupted, such as a user’s finger moving outside the document window, or too many fingers being used at once. A pop-up dialog will also cancel a touch event. </p>
                      <p>The <em>preventDefault() </em>is a method of the event object that can be used inside the callback function to stop the default behavior happening. </p>

                      <h3>Questions:</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>I really don't get it. Why is my Ninja Project (chapter: 5 & 7) won't work? I've been tracing my code if where did I make a mistake. I even compared mine from the codepen it still won't work. What is happening?</p>
                          <p>Is there any command about tap event? If there is what is the difference between the touch event and tap event?</p>
                          <p>How many code exercises are we suppose to make for this week?</p>
                        </li>
