                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Formms)</h5>
                       <p>Forms are made up of a <em><form> </em>element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</p>
                       <p>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.</p>  
                       <p>The <em>focus</em> event occurs when an element is focused on. </p>  
                       <p>The <em>blur </em>event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</p>  
                       <p>The <em>change </em>event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form elementafter changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won’t fire, but the blur event will.</p>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Ch12: Object Oriented Programming)</h5>
                  <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.</p>  
                  <p> There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. </p>  
                  <p><em>Encapsulation</em> involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.</p> 
                  <p><em>Polymorphism</em> various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p> 
                  <p><em>Inheritance</em> means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p> 
                  <p><em>Class-based</em>languages, such as Java and Ruby, use a class to define a blueprint for an object.</p> 
                  <p><em>Prototypebased</em> language d used the concept of using actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects.</p>                              
                  <p>An alternative way to create objects is to use a <em>constructor function</em> -  a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. The keyword <em>this</em> is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</p>
                  <p>A golden rule to remember is: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</p>
                  <p>Giving users or external services too much access to properties and methods could be a recipe for disaster! </p>
                  <p>Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non-enumerable. If they aren’t enumerable, this means they will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an object’s properties and methods.</p>
                  <p>The get() and set() methods can be used to control how a property is set using assignment and the value that is returned when a property is queried.</p>
                  <p>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.</p>
                  <p>The bind() method is a method for all functions and is used to set the value of this in the function. </p>
                  <p>You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. The “Gorilla Banana” problem occurs when you need a method from an object, so you inherit from that object. The name comes from a quote by Joe Armstrong, the creator of the Erlang programming language.</p>

                <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition  (Ch15: Modern Javascript)</h5>
                      <p> JavaScript is an extremely flexible language that
                        can accomplish most programming tasks – but not all undertakings are as easy to
                        do as they should be.</p>
                    
                      <p>jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today.  </p> 
                      <p>A big advantage of using jQuery is its support for older browsers, particularly
                        Internet Explorer.  </p>

                          <p>Is there any example of forms that uses backend in this book? That uses PHP or something?</p>
                          <p>On page 448 ES6 Class Declarations example (Novice to Ninja)  roll() {return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)}, why there's a '+ 1'?</p>
