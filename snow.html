                   <p>Treat opportunities to learn, ask for clarification on parts that didn't make sense. Dont' assume everything is good,
                   spend 5 to 6 hours reading per week. Spent time where it will benefit you, review code examples!</p>

                <p>If you have time work through the exercises at the end of each chapter,
               take notes of questions arose in mind, don't be afraid to find your own sources. Find another explanation. </p>

                <h2>Week3</h2>
                <p>Make sure you invest the time on the assignment. Work together. Do some prep work before your meeting, come ready to contribute. 
                Your teaming is critical to your progress. You will gain so much more by attending your team meetings. 
                Please do not slack off and ignore that experience. As the Mandalorian would say ‘This is the way’.
                Maybe we would say ‘This is the BYU-I way’. We learn together and share what we have learned.
                If you know it all, please share that with the team. If you don’t know anything, PLEASE share your questions because I can guarantee you, there is someone on the team meeting with the same question.</p>

                <h2>Week4</h2>
                <p>Anxiety may still be climbing but it gets better.Don’t be discouraged.
                  Everyone is not at the same level in the class. Ask questions. 
                  Most concepts we are working on in this class can be demonstrated in less than 5 lines of code. 
                  Your team members can no doubt show you some simple examples. 
                  Finally, there is always prayer. If you grouped all of my prayers by topic, surely in the top <strike>ten</strike> five would be prayers about my career.
                  Right now, schooling is your career. I think your Father in Heaven has a pretty good idea about programming.
                  He did an amazing job with DNA. Let Him give you a hand. I have had numerous answers to programming prayers over the years.</p>

                <p>Please come and join the office hours. It would be a shame to miss an opportunity to get some help on your questions. Also it will be a good diversion from the barrage of political advertisements. </p>
