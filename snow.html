                   <p>Treat opportunities to learn, ask for clarification on parts that didn't make sense. Dont' assume everything is good,
                   spend 5 to 6 hours reading per week. Spent time where it will benefit you, review code examples!</p>

                <p>If you have time work through the exercises at the end of each chapter,
               take notes of questions arose in mind, don't be afraid to find your own sources. Find another explanation. </p>

                <p>Make sure you invest the time on the assignment. Work together. Do some prep work before your meeting, come ready to contribute. 
                Your teaming is critical to your progress. You will gain so much more by attending your team meetings. 
                Please do not slack off and ignore that experience. As the Mandalorian would say ‘This is the way’.
                Maybe we would say ‘This is the BYU-I way’. We learn together and share what we have learned.
                If you know it all, please share that with the team. If you don’t know anything, PLEASE share your questions because I can guarantee you, there is someone on the team meeting with the same question.</p>

                <h2>Week4</h2>
                <p>Anxiety may still be climbing but it gets better.Don’t be discouraged.
                  Everyone is not at the same level in the class. Ask questions. 
                  Most concepts we are working on in this class can be demonstrated in less than 5 lines of code. 
                  Your team members can no doubt show you some simple examples. 
                  Finally, there is always prayer. If you grouped all of my prayers by topic, surely in the top <strike>ten</strike> five would be prayers about my career.
                  Right now, schooling is your career. I think your Father in Heaven has a pretty good idea about programming.
                  He did an amazing job with DNA. Let Him give you a hand. I have had numerous answers to programming prayers over the years.</p>

                <p>Please come and join the office hours. It would be a shame to miss an opportunity to get some help on your questions. Also it will be a good diversion from the barrage of political advertisements. </p>

                <h2>Week7</h2>
                <p>You made it HALF WAY!! Your anxiety may be starting to climb at this point. Tou are halfway through the semester and you see more mountains ahead of you. Everything you have learned will be with you for the slopes ahead. Look behind you and see what you have accomplished so far in the semester. I see great examples of your code. Take a half hour and look at some of the examples from your team members and the links I have shared from others in the class. There isn’t one way to do anything, especially in programming!The simplest line of code in JavaScript can be done in 4 ways (x = x + 1; x += 1; x++; ++x;).</p>
                <p>There are arguments for using each one. (BTW go find some articles on x++, some interesting opinions on that simple line of code. Because of that I avoid it more and more). So, take some time to look at alternatives from your peers. I love the perspective I get from looking at other’s code. I use Edabit.com as an assignment in another class I teach. Once you complete a problem you can look at how others have solved it. Sometimes I think ‘well their way is wrong, mine is elegant’, other times I think ‘wow! What a cool approach’. Be open to new ideas which means you need to be out there looking at those new ideas.</p>
                <p>Let’s close with an eternal perspective. One of the underlying principles in the paragraph above may not be obvious. It is revelation. Revelation usually comes after lots of hard work and pondering.</p>
                <p><em>Doctrine and Covenants 9:7,8 Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</em></p>
                <p>Oliver’s desire was the same as yours – to understand an unknown language, not just the words but the meaning as well. <b>Invest the time, study it out and you’ll be successful </b>. I have put this to the test many times with Pascal, APL, Fortran, Jovial, Assembler, SNOBOL, C, Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL (as far as I can tell it does not work with C++, but that just might be me).</p>
                <p>God bless you. Have faith in yourself. <b>Your Father in Heaven believes in you </b>. You should as well.</p>

                <p>How is your motivation? How is your commitment to the team? How is your commitment to your education? This class is your time to learn some basics and then drill down. Explore them. Expand your understanding. Enhance the examples you were given and magnify what you can do with them.  </p>
                <p>Have some fun with your coding. If you are not having fun, you are missing the best parts.</p>
