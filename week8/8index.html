                <li><h5>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real world  (Ch8: Transforms and Transitions)</h5>
                       <p>We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions. Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.   </p>
                       <p>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:
                        transform: translate(45px, -45px);  </p>
                       <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an elementbythe defined factors horizontallythen
                        vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values,
                        growingor shrinkingyour elementor pseudo-element while maintaining theoriginal
                        aspect ratio. transform: scale(1.5, 0.25); </p>
                       <p>A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in
                        other words, the element’s center will stay in the same place as its dimensions
                        change. </p>    
                       <p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified
                        angle value.</p>
                       <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. </p>
                       <p>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that
                        should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</p>
                       <p>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the
                        duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. </p>
                       <p>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in
                        even more granular detail.</p>
                       <p>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to
                        control each step of an animation via keyframes.</p>
                       <p>A keyframe is a snapshot
                        that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.</p>
                       <p>@keyframes moveRight {
                        from {
                        transform: translateX(-50%);
                        }
                        to {
                        transform: translateX(50%);
                        }

                        }

                       <p>The animation-timing-function
                        determines how the animation will progress over its duration. </p>
                       <p>The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the
                       animation will play through.</p>
                       <p>The animation-fill-mode property defines what happensbefore the first animation
                        iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes. </p>
                       <p>Be careful with your animation-name. You want
                        to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as forwards,
                        running, or alternate</p>                             

                 
                </li>

                <li><h5>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real world ( Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop)</h5>
                                
                  <p>To draw a rectangle with a red border,
                    we first define the stroke color:
                    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
                    var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
                    context.strokeStyle = "red";
                    context.fillStyle = "blue";
                  </p>  
                  <p>An arc is a segment of a circle, but as there’s no
                    method for creating a circle, we can draw a 360° arc.</p>  
                  <p>A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. The canvas
                    doesn’t create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers. </p>  
                  <p> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file
                    format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML.</p>  
                  <p>. A major selling point
                    of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG,
                    and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink
                    them down</p>  
                  <p>If you need to paint pixels to the screen and have no concerns about
                    the ability to retrieve and modify your shapes, canvas is probably the better choice</p>    
                  <p>If you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of
                    your graphics, SVG might be more appropriate</p>
