                            <p>I am now starting doing my last week’s goal to read in advance. </p>
                            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) - code using objects to represent entities </p>
                            <p>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</p>
                            <p> Now, this confuses me..what does this "this" do?</p>

                      <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition (Ch5: Objects)</h5>
                             <p>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a <em>method </em>. </p>
                             <p> <em>Object literal</em> is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}</p>
                             <p>To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. <em>const spiderman = {};</em> </p>
                             <p>To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation, parentheses need to be placed after the method name. </p>
                             <p><em>Nested objects</em> an object to contain other objects. </p>
                             <p><em>Math.abs() </em>method returns the absolute value of a number. So if the number is positive, it will remain the same, and if it’s negative, it will become positive</p>
                             <p><em>Math.ceil() </em>method will round a number up to the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer.</p>
                             <p><em>Math.floor() </em>method will round a number down to the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer</p>
                             <p><em>Math.round() </em>method will round a number to the nearest integer.</p>
                             <p><em>Math.exp() </em>method will raise a number to the power of Euler’s constant</p>
                             <p><em>Math.pow() </em>method will raise any number (the first argument) to the power of another number (the second argument)</p>
                             <p>Radians are a standard unit of angular measurement, equal to the angle of the circle’s center corresponding to the arc that subtends it.</p>
                             <p>UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks.</p>       
                      </li>

                      <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition ( Ch6: Document Object Model)</h5>
                            <p>The <em>Document Object Model</em>, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure. </p>
                            <p>The <em>getElementById() </em>method does exactly what it says on the tin. It returns a reference to the element with a unique id attribute that is given as an argument. Every id attribute should be unique to just one element.</p>  
                            <p>The <em>getElementsByTagName() </em>will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag name that is provided as an argument.  </p>
                            <p>The <em>getElementsByClassName() </em>will return a live node list of all elements that have the class name that is supplied as an argument. </p>
                            <p>The <em>document.querySelector() </em>method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return null.</p>
                            <p>The <em>document.querySelectorAll() </em>method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector</p>
                            <p>The <em>classList property</em> is a list of all the classes an element has. It has a number of methods that make it easier to modify the class of an element. </p>
                            <p>The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.</p>
                      </li> 

                      
                      <li><h5>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition  (Ch7: Events)</h5>
                            <p> <em>Events</em> are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing </p>
                            <p>Event listeners in JavaScript work in much the same way. They are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. </p>
                            <p>The <em>addEventListener() </em>method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied.</p>
                            <p>Be careful when using the <em>touchstart </em>event as it fires as soon as a user touches the screen. They may be touching the screen because they want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent them from doing this.</p>  
                            <p>The <em>touchmove</em> event occurs after a user has touched the screen then moves
                              around without leaving.</p>
                            <p>The <em>touchenter</em> event occurs when a user has already started touching the surface, but then passes over the element to which the event listener is attached</p>
                            <p>The <em>touchleave </em>event occurs when the user is still touching the surface, but leaves the element to which the event listener is attached.</p>
                            <p>The <em>touchcancel </em>event occurs when a touch event is interrupted, such as a user’s finger moving outside the document window, or too many fingers being used at once. A pop-up dialog will also cancel a touch event. </p>
                            <p>The <em>preventDefault() </em>is a method of the event object that can be used inside the callback function to stop the default behavior happening. </p>

                                I really don't get it. Why is my Ninja Project (chapter: 5 & 7) won't work? I've been tracing my code if where did I make a mistake. I even compared mine from the codepen it still won't work. What is happening?
