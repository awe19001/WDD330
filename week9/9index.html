              <ul>
                <li><h5>Javascript: Novice to ninja  (Ch9: The Window Object)</h5>
                       <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
                        methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. </p>  
                        If you don't know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the
                        keyword this in the global scope. // from within the global scope
                        const global = this; </p>  
                       <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the
                        URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide
                        information about different fragments of the URL.
                        </p>  
                       <p>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the
                        current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be
                        unable to navigate back to it using the back button.</p> 
                       <p>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is
                        displayed on.</p>  
                       <p>The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has
                        already loaded, it will completely replace the current document.</p> 
                       <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were
                        invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol.</p>  
                       <p> So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is
                        remembered. </p> 
                       <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s 'cookie jar', using the
                        document.cookie property, like so:
                        document.cookie = 'name=Superman';
                        "name=Superman"</p>  
                       <p>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first
                        parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. </p> 
                       <p>The setTimeout() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements
                        on a web page.</p>  
                       <p></p>

                </li>

                <li><h5>Javascript: Novice to ninja  (Ch14: HTML5 APIs)</h5>
                        <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create
                          web pages.</p> 
                        <p>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features
                          to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for
                          other features to be completed. </p>  
                        <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
                          attributes that are ignored by the browser. </p> 
                        <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is
                          similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is
                          generally easier to use. </p>  
                        <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property
                          called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and
                          methods used to store data.</p> 
                        <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.
                          This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby
                          places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.</p>  
                        <p>The position object also has properties that calculate the accuracy of the
                          measurements. </p>  
                        <p> Gseolocation object has a watchPosition() method that will call
                          a callback function every time the position of the device is updated. </p> 
                        <p>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s
                          notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes
                          depending on the operating system. </p>  
                        <p>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web
                          page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas element is a rectangular element on
                          the web page. </p> 
                        <p>The fillText() method is used to write text onto the canvas. The first parameter
                          is the text to be displayed, while the next two parameters are the x and y
                          coordinates, respectively. </p>
